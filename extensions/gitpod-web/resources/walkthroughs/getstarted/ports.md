# Ports

If your application listens on any port, e.g. a web application, Gitpod provides a URL for you to access your application.

A list of ports is available in the "Remote Explorer" panel on the left-hand side. [Click here to open the panel.](command:gitpod.ports.reveal)

_Note_: To get back to the list of files in your project, click the "Explorer" icon on the left-hand side.

## Documentation

To learn more about ports and how to configure them, please [refer to the documentation](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/config-ports).
